Hello! Welcome to my website. My name is Ahiko or you can call me Cake. I am a forever noob cakelet with an undying love for RPGs. I love adventures and Iâ€™d love to share mine with you!

I work full-time as a UI Engineer in San Francisco and like to stream during my free time. No set schedule yet, but usually stream Tuesdays & Thursdays around 7PM PST!
