## About Me

Hello! My name is **Ahiko** or you can call me **Cake**. I am a forever noob cakelet with an undying love for RPGs. I love adventures and I'd love to share mine with you!

Off stream, I am a UI Engineer in San Francisco and studied Computer Science and Public Health. I have two bunnies, Lord Vader and Padme, who hang out on stream with us!
