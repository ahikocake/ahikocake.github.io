## About

Hello! Welcome to my channel. My name is **Ahiko** or you can call me **Cake**. I am a forever noob cakelet with an undying love for RPGs. I love adventures and I'd love to share mine with you!

I work full-time as a UI Engineer in San Francisco and like to play with my bunnies, Lord Vader and Padme, when I'm not streaming.
